### Final Diagnosis:

* **Diabetic Cardiomyopathy**: The patient's high blood sugar levels may have damaged the heart muscle, leading to decreased cardiac function, as suggested by the Cardiologist's report, and potentially exacerbated by the patient's history of diabetes and lifestyle changes.
* **Anxiety and Depression**: The patient may be experiencing anxiety and depression related to their diagnosis, lifestyle changes, and family history of diabetes, as indicated in the Psychologist's report, which could be contributing to their overall health issues and interacting with potential cardiac and respiratory problems.
* **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: The patient's smoking history and potential pulmonary complications related to diabetes may have increased their risk of developing COPD, as noted in the Pulmonologist's report, which could be contributing to symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath, and may be related to cardiac issues such as decreased oxygenation.
